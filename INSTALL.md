# Dog Walking Schedule - Installation Guide

## âœ… Fixed Issues

The integration has been updated to fix the "This integration cannot be added from the UI" error.

### Changes Made:
1. âœ… Added `"config_flow": true` to `manifest.json`
2. âœ… Created `translations/en.json` for UI localization
3. âœ… Verified all required files are present

## ðŸš€ Installation Steps

### 1. Copy Files
Ensure the entire `dog_walking` folder is in your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory:
```
/config/custom_components/dog_walking/
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”œâ”€â”€ config_flow.py
â”œâ”€â”€ const.py
â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json
â”œâ”€â”€ sensor.py
â”œâ”€â”€ services.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ strings.json
â”œâ”€â”€ translations/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ en.json
â”œâ”€â”€ examples/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ automations.yaml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dashboard.yaml
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

### 2. Restart Home Assistant
**Important**: Do a full restart, not just a reload:
- Go to Settings â†’ System â†’ Restart
- Wait for Home Assistant to fully restart

### 3. Add Integration
1. Go to Settings â†’ Devices & Services
2. Click "Add Integration" (+ button)
3. Search for "dog" or "Dog Walking Schedule"
4. Click on "Dog Walking Schedule"

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### If the integration still doesn't appear:

1. **Check file permissions**:
   ```bash
   chmod -R 755 /config/custom_components/dog_walking/
   ```

2. **Check Home Assistant logs**:
   - Go to Settings â†’ System â†’ Logs
   - Look for any errors related to "dog_walking"

3. **Verify file structure**:
   - Make sure all files are in the correct locations
   - Check that `manifest.json` contains `"config_flow": true`

4. **Clear browser cache**:
   - Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)

5. **Check Home Assistant version**:
   - This integration requires Home Assistant 2023.1 or later

### If you get import errors:
- Make sure you're running this in Home Assistant, not standalone Python
- The integration uses Home Assistant's built-in libraries
